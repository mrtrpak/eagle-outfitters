## Concepts Learned

- Memoization
- Currying
- Data Normalization: Objects being better for searching for items than Array. This is a common computing optimization when talking about data structures.

## Why Redux

- a great way to manage large amount of data in state

- useful for sharing data between components

- Predictable state management using 3 principles
  - single source of truth
  - state is read only
  - changes using pure functions

### Redux Flow

- Action: event by user
- Root Reducer: function that receives an input and an expected output (pure)
- Store: entire state of the app
- DOM Changes: the new state makes updates to the DOM
