# Eagle Outfitters

## Goal

- Using create react app and React I am making a mock online clothing shop to enhance my react knowledge and capabilities.

## Tools Used

- React
- Firebase
- Redux
- Reselect

## Why Redux

- a great way to manage large amount of data in state

- useful for sharing data between components

- Predictable state management using 3 principles
  - single source of truth
  - state is read only
  - changes using pure functions

### Redux Flow

- Action: event by user
- Root Reducer: function that receives an input and an expected output (pure)
- Store: entire state of the app
- DOM Changes: the new state makes updates to the DOM

## App Layout

### UI Features
